<h1>Extended Create-React-App-TypeScript</h1>

This project was initially bootstrapped with [TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter). Later, since _create-react-app_ natively supported TypeScript, migrated to native module by following these [steps](https://vincenttunru.com/migrate-create-react-app-typescript-to-create-react-app/).

This project is an extended _TypeScript React Starter_ having many other useful and widely used modules for a React Application development using Typescript.

Apart from those basic modules given by TsRS, currently this starter template includes below plugins as well.

- [React-Jss](https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss)
- [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames)
- [React-Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux)

<hr />

I am planning to use this template to bootstrap my other React Projects. During my development phase, when I come across other useful plugins/modules that would be widely used across in a react development, I will add those too here and improve this boilerplate project.

Contributions are invited, to make this template project grow rich with useful plugins, ultimately as a One-Stop-Shop solution for easily spanning out a base structure for building wonderful **React** Applications.
